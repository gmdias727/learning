In clojure there is a concept os threading

# What the fvck is Threading?

Threading means inserting the result of an expression into another expression

Note: The word "thread" in this context (meaning passing a value through a pipeline of functions) is unrelated to the concept of concurrent threads of execution. (from https://clojure.org/guides/threading_macros)
