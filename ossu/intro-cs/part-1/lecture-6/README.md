# Decomposition and ABSTRACTION

## Decomposition

- Ideally parts can be reused by other programs
- Self-contained means parts should be complete computation using only inputs provided to them and "basic" operations

## Abstraction

- Used to separate what something does, from how it actually does it
- Creating parts and abstracting away details allows us to write complex code while supressing details, wo that we are not overwhelmed by that complexity.
