# The Recipe

1. From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions

    Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in the chosen programming languages. Formulate data definitions and ilustrate them with examples.

2. Signature, Purpose Statement, Header

    State what kind of data the desired function consumes and produces. Formulate a concise answer to the question *what* the function computes. Define a stub that lives up to the signature.

3. Functional Examples

    Work through examples that illustrate the function's purpose.

4. Function Template

    Translate the data definitions into an outline of the function.

5. Function Definition

    Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.

6. Testing

    Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all. Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests also supplement examples in that they help others read and understand the definition the need arises - and it will arise for any serious program.
